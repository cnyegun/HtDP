# How to Design Program
*By “good programming,” we mean an approach to the creation of software that relies on systematic thought, planning, and understanding from the very beginning, at every stage, and for every step. To emphasize the point, we speak of systematic program design and systematically designed programs. Critically, the latter articulates the rationale of the desired functionality. Good programming also satisfies an aesthetic sense of accomplishment; the elegance of a good program is comparable to time-tested poems or the black-and-white photographs of a bygone era. In short, programming differs from good programming like crayon sketches in a diner from oil paintings in a museum.*

This repo serves as a personal log when I'm going through the How to Design Program book and the course Systematic Program Design

Update 2025: I've finished this course, it is truly awesome. I'll write a review for it later when I have time and can reflex more on the knowledge I got from this.
